THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This code has been tested using WSL
To run the code, use the makefile
      Write make all, which will compile and run the program
To clean write make clean


To switch between whitebox and blackbox testing, comment out whitebox or Polynomial_Multiply in main


The results when running the test:

n size: 16m iterations: 100000
DFT multiplication time: 1.828125 seconds.
FFT multiplication time: 0.187500 seconds.
iterative_FFT multiplication time: 0.109375 seconds.
karatsuba multiplication time: 0.187500 seconds.
